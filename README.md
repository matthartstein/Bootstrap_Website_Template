This program creates a website from a Bootstrap template that I've edited and prepared for immedate use for freelance projects. The webpage utilizes Bootstrap templates, buttons, logos, etc. as well as JavaScript functions and basic HTML to successfully render.

I've added Python Flask to locally host this webpage to showcase my knowledge with Flask. If you do not have this installed on your computer, simply double click the HTML page to view the dynamic website.
